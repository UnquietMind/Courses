        "**Modals** are a special group of words that help main verbs, so they are called **helping verbs**. In a sentence they usually come after the subject and before the main verb. When you put a modal with a main verb it gives the verb a special meaning. You will learn about the special meanings in other lessons, but first let's take a look at the group of modals. Can, could, may, might, should, had better, must, will, and would. **The most important rule about modals is that they never change**. He cans, no, they woulded, no. **The second most important rule is when you combine modals with verbs, the verb stays in the original form.** Original form means there is no -s, -ing, or -ed ending. For example, take the sentence, She runs. If I add can, it becomes She can run. The s is gone. Here are some more sample sentences. The students wore a uniform. I am taking the dog out. The boy is sick. If I add a modal to each of these sentences, the verb changes back to the original form. The students must wear a uniform. I should take the dog out. The boy might be sick."
